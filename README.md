# Smart Parking System

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg) 

This is the codebase for the Smart Parking System.

This system is built upon the Material Dashboard 2 React from [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard-react?ref=readme-mdr).


## Project Details

### **Introduction**

This application allows users to see the available spaces in all parking lots, park and check out their vehicles via a simple click, and pay for each parking session automatically. In this app, a database system will store the user and vehicle information, as well as the up-to-date status of all parking lots and parking spaces. Moreover, it will also save the userâ€™s parking and payment history for administrative and tracing purposes.

### **Important Files and Folders**

- `./src/layouts/`: JS files containing frontend codes for web console
- `./src/sql/`: SQL files containing the SQL source codes
- `./app.py`: Python file for backend development; integrating with SQL source codes of the required functions

### **User Manual**

The complete report for this project, including the user manual, is [here](./Project_Report.pdf).

### **Component Documentation by Creative Tim**

Each element is well presented in very complex documentation.
